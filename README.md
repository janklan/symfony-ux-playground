# Symfony UX Live Component Form playground

Minimal working code examples to demonstrate things I'm talking about elsewhere (PRs, bug reports etc).

*How to use:*

This app is built with `symfony new` and uses sqlite.

1. `composer install && npm install && npx encore production && bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force` will set you up
2. `symfony serve` will start the server
3. When you open the default home for the first time, the system creates some fixtures, so you're good to go.
